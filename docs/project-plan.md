# ⚔️ Before That Resolves - Developer Learning Plan

**Master @openai/agents SDK by Building a Commander/EDH Assistant**

> 📚 **IMPORTANT**: This is a learning project for YOU, the developer. The goal is to teach you the OpenAI Agents SDK through practical implementation. While you're learning agent patterns, your users will simply see a powerful MTG Commander assistant with no exposure to SDK concepts.

## Project Overview

**Before That Resolves** is a developer learning project designed to teach you the OpenAI Agents SDK through practical implementation. By building a fully-functional MTG Commander assistant, you'll progressively learn agent patterns, from basic tool creation to complex multi-agent orchestration.

**Your Learning Journey**: Each MTG feature you implement teaches specific SDK concepts.
**The End Product**: A legitimate Commander deck builder and strategy tool (with no SDK concepts exposed to users).

The name serves dual purpose: it's the iconic MTG phrase for stack interaction, and a perfect metaphor for the agent handoff patterns you'll master.

## Your SDK Learning Objectives

Through building this MTG assistant, you will learn to:

1. **Create Specialized Agents** - Build domain experts with specific capabilities
2. **Master Zod Validation** - Implement complex schemas for data validation
3. **Manage Agent State** - Persist and share context across agent calls
4. **Orchestrate External APIs** - Wrap third-party services as agent tools
5. **Implement Agent Logic** - Build reasoning systems for strategic decisions
6. **Handle Errors Gracefully** - Create robust fallback and retry patterns
7. **Deploy Production Systems** - Build scalable, maintainable agent architectures

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, React Context for UI
