This document tracks the development sessions for "Before That Resolves," a project where the developer (you) learns the @openai/agents SDK by building a fully-functional MTG Commander/EDH assistant.

---

## Session 1: Initial SDK Learning & Examples
**Date**: September 18, 2025
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.1
**Focus**: Building a learning workspace for the @openai/agents SDK with GPT-5 codex integration

### Context
- Started with an existing TypeScript project structure for learning agentic AI
- Discovered the user has access to GPT-5 via the `codex` CLI tool
- Needed to learn the new @openai/agents SDK (version 0.1.3) which was beyond Claude's training data

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- **Created Agent Configuration**: Built `ai-config/claude/agents/openai-agents-sdk.md`
  - Proactive agent that combines embedded SDK knowledge with GPT-5 reasoning
  - Auto-activates on SDK-related keywords
  - Executes codex commands for complex SDK patterns
- **Verified Codex CLI**: Confirmed access to GPT-5 model via `codex -m gpt-5-codex exec`
- **Installed Dependencies**: Added `@openai/agents` and `zod@3` to the workspace

#### 2. Working Examples Developed

##### Basic Agent (`src/examples/basic-agent-sdk.ts`)
- Demonstrates fundamental SDK concepts
- Calculator and web search tools with Zod validation
- Interactive mode for testing
- Pattern: `createAgent()`, `tool()`, `runAgent()`

##### Multi-Agent Swarm (`src/examples/multi-agent-swarm.ts`)
- Five specialized agents with distinct roles:
  - **Planner**: Breaks down complex requests
  - **Coordinator**: Manages task execution
  - **Researcher**: Gathers information
  - **Analyst**: Analyzes data
  - **Reviewer**: Quality control and summarization
- Shared state management via `SwarmState` class
- Dynamic handoffs between agents
- Task queue system for coordination

##### Advanced Tools (`src/examples/advanced-tools-zod.ts`)
- Complex Zod schema patterns:
  - Email, phone, URL validation
  - Nested object schemas
  - Discriminated unions for variant types
  - Custom validation rules with `.refine()`
- Five sophisticated tools:
  - Person management (CRUD operations)
  - Product catalog (multiple product types)
  - File operations (with safety checks)
  - API requests (simulated)
  - Data transformation and validation
- Type inference from schemas using `z.infer<>`

#### 3. Documentation
- **Learnings Document** (`docs/learnings-agents-sdk.md`):
  - SDK architecture breakdown
  - Core concepts (Agents, Tools, Handoffs)
  - Discovered patterns and best practices
  - Codex CLI integration strategies
  - Migration guide from traditional OpenAI SDK
  - Performance considerations
  - Testing strategies

### Key Patterns Discovered

```typescript
const myTool = tool({
  name: 'toolName',
  description: 'Clear description',
  parameters: z.object({ /* Zod schema */ }),
  execute: async (params) => { /* implementation */ }
});
```

2. **Agent Handoff Pattern**:
```typescript
agent.handoff = [
  handoff({
    agent: targetAgent,
    description: 'When to hand off'
  })
];
```

3. **Shared State Pattern**:
- Centralized state management for multi-agent coordination
- Tools that read/write to shared state
- Task queue for work distribution

### Technical Insights

1. **SDK Structure**:

## Session 4: Critical Reframing & Clean Implementation Start
**Date**: September 19, 2025 (Late Afternoon)
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.1
**Focus**: Understanding true project purpose and beginning clean implementation

### Critical Clarification

**Key Realization**: This project is for teaching the DEVELOPER (you) the OpenAI Agents SDK, NOT for teaching app users about AI. The MTG Commander app is the vehicle for learning, but users only see MTG features.

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Documentation Reframing
- **Updated README.md**:
  - Explicitly states this is a developer learning project
  - Separated "What You Learn" (SDK patterns) from "What Users See" (MTG features)
  - Removed all user-facing "learning mode" features

- **Updated project-plan.md**:
  - Renamed "concepts" to "lessons" throughout
  - Each lesson now shows SDK learning objectives vs. MTG features built
  - Success metrics track developer learning milestones
  - Added clear note: "This is a learning project for YOU, the developer"

#### 2. Clean Slate Implementation
- **Removed Old Code**:
  - Deleted generic `src/` directory with non-MTG agent code
  - Removed old `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `node_modules`
  - Started completely fresh to avoid confusion

- **Created New Structure**:
  ```
  before-that-resolves/
  ├── client/       # React + Vite frontend
  ├── server/       # Express + OpenAI SDK backend
  ├── shared/       # Shared TypeScript types
  └── docs/         # Developer learning documentation
  ```

#### 3. Development Environment Setup
- **Frontend (client/)**:
  - React 18 + TypeScript + Vite initialized
  - Tailwind CSS configured with MTG-themed colors
  - Basic app shell created showing project status

- **Backend (server/)**:
  - Express server with TypeScript
  - Placeholder endpoints for future agent implementation
  - CORS and middleware configured

- **Shared Types (shared/)**:
  - Basic `Card` and `DeckList` interfaces
  - `AgentQuery` and `AgentResponse` types
  - Foundation for type-safe development

#### 4. Dependency Management
- Monorepo setup with npm workspaces
- All packages installed including `@openai/agents` SDK
- Build verification: All packages compile successfully

### Key Insights from This Session

1. **Learning Focus Clarity**: The project's purpose is YOUR education in the SDK, not user education about AI
2. **Clean Start Value**: Removing old code prevented conceptual confusion
3. **Progressive Learning Path**: 10 lessons, each teaching specific SDK patterns through MTG features
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Users see Commander assistant, developer learns agent orchestration

### Technical Details

## Session 5: Lesson 1 - Card Oracle Agent Implementation
**Date**: September 19, 2025 (Evening)
**Model**: Claude Opus 4.1
**Session Cost**: $31.60 (Claude statusline) + ~$5-10 (estimated SDK agent/codex calls) = ~$37-42 total
**Focus**: Implementing first agent with @openai/agents SDK v0.1.3

### Learning Objectives Achieved

Successfully completed **Lesson 1: Card Oracle Agent**, learning:
- Basic agent creation with `new Agent()`
- Tool implementation with `tool()` and Zod schemas
- External API integration (Scryfall)
- Proper SDK v0.1.3 patterns

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. Scryfall API Integration
- **Created `scryfall.ts` service**:
  - Rate limiting (100ms between requests)
  - Card search by name (fuzzy matching)
  - Advanced search with complex queries
  - Random commander suggestions
  - Card rulings retrieval

#### 2. Tool Creation with Zod
- **Built 5 MTG card tools** (`card-tools.ts`):
  - `searchCardTool` - Basic card lookup
  - `advancedSearchTool` - Complex queries with filters
  - `getCardRulingsTool` - Official rulings
  - `randomCommanderTool` - Commander suggestions
  - `checkCommanderLegalityTool` - Legality validation

#### 3. Card Oracle Agent Implementation
- **Learned correct SDK v0.1.3 patterns**:
  - Used `new Agent()` not `createAgent()`
  - Used `run()` not `runAgent()`
  - Learned run() takes string or array, not `{messages: []}`
  - Created helper functions for response extraction

#### 4. Critical SDK Learning
- **Used openai-agents-sdk specialized agent**:
  - Got correct v0.1.3 API patterns
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
  - Learned actual result structure differs from docs
  - Agent class doesn't support `temperature` property

#### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- **Created test components**:
  - Server test script (`test-agent.ts`)
  - React component (`CardOracleTest.tsx`)
  - Connected frontend to backend API
  - Verified with real MTG queries

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **SDK API Mismatch**:
   - **Issue**: Initial implementation used wrong API patterns
   - **Solution**: Used SDK specialized agent to get correct v0.1.3 patterns
   - **Learning**: Always verify actual SDK exports when docs unclear

2. **TypeScript Compilation**:
   - **Issue**: Result structure didn't match expected types
   - **Solution**: Created helper functions to handle actual structure
   - **Learning**: SDK returns `result.output` array, not `result.messages`

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - **Issue**: Assumed .env file needed
   - **Solution**: System environment variable works directly
   - **Learning**: System env vars take precedence, more secure

### Code Structure Created

```

client/
└── components/
    └── CardOracleTest.tsx     # UI for testing agent
```

### Working Examples Tested

Successfully tested queries:
- "What is Lightning Bolt?" → Detailed card info
- "Can Atraxa be my commander?" → Legality check with explanation
- "Find blue instant spells" → Advanced search results
- "What are the rulings for Thassa's Oracle?" → Official rulings
- "Is Sol Ring legal in Commander?" → Clarified card vs commander legality

### Key SDK Patterns Learned

1. **Agent Creation**:
```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'Card Oracle',           // Optional
  model: 'gpt-4o',               // Required
  instructions: 'You are...',     // Required
  tools: [tool1, tool2]          // Tools array
});
```

2. **Running Agent**:
```typescript
const result = await run(agent, [
  { role: 'user', content: query }
]);
const response = extractResponseText(result);
```

3. **Tool Pattern**:
```typescript
const tool = tool({
  name: 'tool_name',
  description: 'What it does',
  parameters: z.object({ ... }),
  execute: async (params) => { ... }
});
```

### Session Summary

Lesson 1 successfully completed! Built a working Card Oracle Agent that answers MTG questions using the Scryfall API. Learned fundamental @openai/agents SDK patterns through practical implementation. The agent works with system environment variables (no .env needed) and provides detailed, accurate responses about Magic cards. Ready to commit and push to GitHub repository.
