/**
 * LESSON 1: Your First Agent!
 *
 * This is the Card Oracle Agent - it helps users with MTG card information.
 *
 * KEY CONCEPTS FOR @openai/agents v0.1.3:
 * 1. new Agent() - Creates an agent instance with specific capabilities
 * 2. Tool registration - Giving the agent tools to use
 * 3. Instructions - Defining the agent's behavior
 * 4. run() function - Executing the agent with user input
 *
 * The agent will automatically:
 * - Understand user intent
 * - Choose appropriate tools
 * - Handle tool responses
 * - Generate helpful answers
 */

// Create the Card Oracle Agent using the Agent class
export const cardOracleAgent = new Agent({
  // Agent name (optional)
  name: 'Card Oracle',

  // Model configuration
  model: openaiConfig.model || 'gpt-4o',

  // System instructions define the agent's personality and knowledge
  instructions: `You are the Card Oracle, an expert on Magic: The Gathering cards and the Commander/EDH format.

Your role is to help players with:
- Finding specific cards and their details
- Explaining card rulings and interactions
- Checking commander legality
- Suggesting commanders for different playstyles
- Understanding card text and abilities

You have access to the entire Scryfall database of Magic cards. Be helpful, accurate, and enthusiastic about Magic!

When discussing cards:
- Always mention the mana cost and type
- Explain important abilities clearly
- Note the color identity for Commander purposes
- Mention power/toughness for creatures

Remember: Commander is a singleton format (only one of each card except basic lands) with 100-card decks led by a legendary creature.`,

  // Tools the agent can use
  tools: [

/**
 * Execute the Card Oracle Agent
 *
 * LEARNING POINT: Using the run() function with Agent!
 * The agent will:
 * 1. Analyze the query
 * 2. Decide which tools to use (if any)
 * 3. Call the tools with appropriate parameters
 * 4. Synthesize the results into a response

/**
 * LEARNING CHECKPOINT for @openai/agents v0.1.3:
 *
 * You've now created your first agent! Here's what you learned:
 *
 * 1. Agents are created with new Agent() and configured with:
 *    - name for identity (optional)
 *    - instructions for behavior
 *    - tools array for capabilities
 *    - model for the LLM to use
 *    - Note: temperature is NOT a valid property in v0.1.3
 *
 * 2. Tools are created with the tool() function:
 *    - name and description for the agent to understand
 *    - parameters as Zod schemas for validation
 *    - execute function that returns data
 *    - The agent decides when/how to use them
 *
 * 3. Running an agent with run() function:
 *    - Accepts either a string or array of input items
 *    - NOT an object with { messages: [...] }
 *    - Returns a result with:
 *      - result.output: array of output items
 *      - result.state: contains the conversation state
 *    - Does NOT return result.messages
 *
 * Next, we'll connect this to your Express server so you can test it!
